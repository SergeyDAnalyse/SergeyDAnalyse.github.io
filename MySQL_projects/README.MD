# Normalising, organising, and analysing data using MySQL 
The present repository contains personal data analysis projects completed with the use of MySQL.

## French bakery sales
MySQL script: [Fr_bakery_normalisation.sql](MySQL_projects/Fr_baker_upl_MySQL.py)
Python script: [Fr_baker_MySQL_upl.py](MySQL_projects/Fr_bakery_normalisation.sql)
The dataset was retrieved from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matthieugimbert/french-bakery-daily-sales). The dataset contains 7 columns and 234004 rows.
Some of the major objectives of this project are:
* Design a custome Python script to upload the data on MySQL server;
* Perform data transformation and normalisation;
* Calculate derivative columns;
* Create views that could be utilised to visualise the key findings later
